<p>User Story
<p>AS AN employer
<p>I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
<p> SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

<p> Acceptance Criteria
<p>GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
<p>WHEN I load their portfolio
<p>THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
<p>WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
<p>THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
<p>WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
<p>THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
<p>WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
<p>WHEN I click on the images of the applications
<p>THEN I am taken to that deployed application
<p>WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
<p> THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
